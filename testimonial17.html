		I had practiced diligently back in 2004-2005 in Colorado. I donated a kidney in 2005 and got out of practice, 
		stopping Bikram altogether. Recently, I began my practice at your studio and have had amazing results. Your 
		instructors (hosts) are the best I have ever had! I can't remember names well, although they do an excellent 
		job of remembering mine, but they all have really great strengths.<p>
 
		"Little Richard" is so amazing. She literally talks through the postures down to where I should be every second. 
		This really makes the 60 seconds go so quickly because I am not concentrating on the time but each facet of the 
		posture. The gal with the red hair is also extrordinary. She makes it very entertaining and she also has her own 
		way of talking through each posture. There are two others and they are also awesome. <p>
 
		I have lost 12lbs in the last three weeks but gained enormous confidence. I have a new addiction and I couldn't be happier about it!<p>
