		So I’ve been doing Bikram Yoga for roughly 1.5 years now and I must say this stuff is amazing. I've competed in soccer,
		hockey, wrestling, and I’m also pretty good at table tennis... and nothing even remotely compares to the intensity of
		Bikram Yoga. It's creepy cool how much muscle and toning I’ve gotten from this practice. I've got muscles now that I
		never knew I had! I also love the state of mind I get from yoga. After a class, everything in life just kind of slows
		down to a manageable halt. It reminds of that scene in the Matrix where Neo bends the spoon... It's an amazing feeling.
		But I have to say, the main thing I love about Bikram is the instructors. Because of their influence, I'm better at my
		job, which coincidently enough, is being a teacher. I notice myself using their mannerisms and life lessons in my 
		classroom. They are encouraging, helpful, intelligent, caring, funny, assertive, and just all around cool. When I'm at
		the Chesterfield or Clayton studio they create a sense of community and family that lets me feel like I’m a part of
		something bigger and worthwhile... It is that reason that I drive about 45 minutes to endure one and half hours of heat
		3 days a week and love every minute of it.<p>
