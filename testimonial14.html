		I've always been a bit of a workout freak - I like to push myself
		and rarely, if ever, admit defeat.  Currently, I am rowing for the
		Wash U crew team.  A little more than a year ago, mid-erg (a terrible
		indoor rowing torture machine for those who haven't been
		acquainted with it), I noticed that my entire right wrist was slowly
		turning black and blue.  Within a week I had a 10-inch bruise along
		my forearm.  Diagnosed with a torn tendon and severe tendonitis, I
		went through a succession of cortisone shots, and ultimately had two
		surgeries to try and ease my pain.  Nothing worked.  I've been
		forced to become a lefty for the past year (which, as a college
		student, is a rather difficult chore).  Recently, I told my coach
		that I'd be taking a semester off from rowing to try and finally
		fix my wrist.  While I have always dabbled in Bikram, coming for a
		few days here and a few days there, I decided to attend a minimum of 3
		classes a week.  It has been nearly 3 months since I committed myself
		to my practice and I have gained nearly 60 degrees of motion in my
		wrist!  I no longer have any pain and I can finally get into a pushup
		position (thank you cobra!)  The other day my dad called and asked if
		I was still going to PT or was I just "Bikraming it up?" Yes, I'm
		just Bikraming it up, and I plan to continue to do so!
