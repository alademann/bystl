		<font size=2><b>Bikram Yoga During Pregnancy</b></font><p>
		<!--<img src="images/yolanda.jpg" width="200"><p>-->
		I “happened” into my first Bikram Yoga class.  I was living in Washington DC, but traveling in San Francisco 
		on business.  I overheard someone in my company talking about a hot yoga class.  I was intrigued, having 
		always enjoyed physical challenges (weight training, running and other forms of yoga were my mainstays).  
		I approached my coworker and got the address of the hot yoga studio.  (Funky Door in San Fran)<p>
		As I entered this studio, I immediately felt a different energy.  I must say I was a bit intimidated.  
		The lobby/entrance to the studio was not hot; I’m not sure what I expected.  I saw all of these 
		“interesting” people completely wet, both men and women in skimpy attire, milling about.<p>
		I sat outside the studio and waited for the regulars to go in.  Then I entered my first Bikram studio.  
		I remember thinking, wow this is pretty hot, but since it is yoga, and it is a meditative practice 
		(i.e. not much movement – or so I thought) it should be ok.  The class started with breathing and I still 
		thought it wouldn’t be too strenuous.  Then, the rest of the now, second-nature, 26 postures started.  
		To be honest, I don’t remember much after that. To make matters worse, I had forgotten my water outside 
		in my rental car, so I went through the entire class – my first class- without water! <p>
		I remember going back to my hotel room after the class, ordering Chinese food, barely eating, drinking 
		a gallon of water and falling asleep by 7 pm that night, not waking up until the next morning.<p>
		As I woke up I was energized and felt like I needed to try it again.  A month later, back in DC I looked 
		up Bikram Yoga on the web and found two studios. I picked one and went.  This was a very different makeup 
		of students.  A true East Coast crowd vs. the West Coast crew I had previously experienced.  After the 
		class I spoke to Jim, the studio owner and developed a friendship with him.  Over the next few months, 
		I attended class 3 to 5 times per week while training for a marathon and continuing my weight training.  
		I soon noticed that my running was significantly improved due to the yoga.  I ran my marathon, the Marine 
		Corp Marathon, and finished it with ease.  <p> 
		Since my job required a lot of travel, I practiced in every city I went to.  It was a pleasure to visit 
		so many Bikram studios and experience the many teaching styles yet always be in the now-familiar 26 
		postures and hear the consistent dialog.<p>
		At the recommendation of my teacher, I started entertaining the idea of attending the teacher training 
		to kick my practice into the highest gear.  Its funny how things work out the way they should.  All 
		events and situations in my life aligned themselves so that I had a clear understanding that I should 
		attend.  So I did.<p>
		I can easily say that it was by far, the best experience of my life up to that point. Not only was it an 
		amazing physical experience, it was also cleansing for my soul.  I could go on about this forever, but 
		won't for now.  Suffice to say, if you want to take your practice and yourself to a level you never thought 
		possible, consider this experience, whether you want to teach or not.<p>
		After training my practice was amazing for approximately one year.  I was going to class a minimum of 6 
		days a week (sometimes doing doubles – a practice I had acquired a taste for during training) and I was 
		able to attain a depth in the postures that I never thought my body would reach.  <p>
		In the following few months I met my soul-mate, Richard, married him after only knowing him for 16 days 
		and moved to St. Louis, his hometown.  I still remember the relief when I looked at the Bikram website 
		and saw that a studio had just opened up there.<p>
		The moment I came into the St. Louis studio I was greeted with warmth.  After a brief conversation 
		with Erin and Carol, and introducing myself as a teacher, I sensed the awesome discipline in the studio.  
		I can’t stress enough how important this discipline is and how it is at the very heart of Bikram’s teachings.  
		My first class here was reminiscent of the teacher training.  You see, Carol and Erin expect only the best 
		from you but they are ALWAYS willing to give their best back.  <p>
		I spoke so highly of this studio that my husband decided to try the yoga.  An athlete himself, he was 
		pleasantly surprised at how much he enjoyed it and was challenged by it.  Richard will tell you, that after 
		6 knee surgeries, a couple of car accidents and many athletic related injuries, his body has never felt 
		so good.  Now, yoga is part of his regimen along with the other healing practices he has found such as 
		acupuncture and massage.<p>
		After practicing in St. Louis for only two months I became pregnant at the age of 39.  I am confident 
		that the benefits of a healthy approach to nutrition, a lifestyle inclusive of exercise and the many 
		benefits Bikram yoga made this process an easier one for my body to go through.<p>
		I had an amazing pregnancy and throughout it, practiced the yoga religiously 6 days a week.  The only 
		day – Thursday – that I did not practice was Erin and Carol’s only day off.  As my body changed with 
		each facet of pregnancy, I found myself needing to come to class and stand in the hot room.  You see, 
		this was the only place my body felt like my pre-pregnancy body.  My stamina was fueled by the yoga.  
		I was not aware of what was to come and how much I would need this stamina through what was a very long 
		(37 hour) labor.  I practiced until two days before my beautiful baby boy, Giovanni, was born.  And came 
		back to my practice 2 weeks later.<p>
		Throughout this time, I spoke to many students and answered questions about this yoga and pregnancy.  
		I even educated my doctor as to the benefits of this yoga.  She is now a believer and a proponent of 
		this yoga.<p>
		I can highly recommend Bikram Yoga throughout pregnancy with one major footnote.  This is <u>not</u> the type of 
		strenuous activity that you should start while you are pregnant.  This is a practice to <u>continue</u> throughout
		your pregnancy <u><b>IF</b></u> you practiced Bikram yoga before you became pregnant.  You should not start an exercise 
		plan or a practice during a pregnancy.<p>
		Bikram yoga is a life changing experience and I can guarantee it will take you (if you let it) to places 
		you never knew you could go.<p>--Yolanda

		<a name="andy"><font size=2 color="#0F1C2B"><b>Plantar Fasciitis</b></font></a><p>
		I am a triathlete and for the last two years, I have suffered from plantar fasciitis 
		(an inflammation of the connective tissue that spans the arch of your foot). As a result, 
		the arch of my left foot was a mass of painful adhesions from all the scar tissue as I continued 
		to train through the treatment process. Just before my first Bikram yoga class, I got a massage from 
		the person that works with the St. Louis Rams and the St. Louis Blues. When the masseuse started to 
		work on the bottom of my left foot, the pain was so intense, I couldn’t stay quiet or still. 
		Up until then, I was thinking that with a complete month off of training, I might have seen the 
		last of my problems with plantar fasciitis. Apparently I was wrong.<p>
		I had heard that Bikram yoga was an excellent way to improve flexibility, so I decided to try it out. 
		My first class was totally different from anything I had ever done. Bikram yoga was a challenge, but it 
		was also a blast. I knew immediately I had found something both different and special. I immediately 
		started coming three times a week, but after seeing significant gains in flexibility in less than two 
		weeks, I bumped it up to five times a week. After three more weeks of yoga (for a total of five weeks), 
		I went back for another massage with the same masseuse. Near the end of the massage, she asked me if my 
		left foot wasn’t the one having the problem with plantar fasciitis. I replied that it was and asked why 
		she had inquired. She told me she was applying the same pressure as she had the previous visit, but that 
		I was not responding at all the same. Only then did I realize that all the pain and sensitivity on the 
		arch of my left foot was gone. <p>
		Thinking back, I recalled occasionally feeling some fleeting pain during one of my yoga postures, but 
		I had assumed the posture was exacerbating my plantar fasciitis, not curing it. Apparently, once 
		again, I was wrong. But this time, I was delighted to be wrong. I decided to put it to the test and 
		tried running, biking and swimming, but the pain was truly gone. After having to miss workouts and 
		hold back on my training all this time, I am really excited to see what I can do now. <p>
		When I started doing Bikram yoga, I had no idea how much I would enjoy it or how much it could help me. 
		I was initially only interested in gaining flexibility but I got far more than I expected. Now I realize 
		Bikram yoga is a mechanism for healing both the body and the mind and I understand why I have been 
		feeling so happy and why I look forward to every class. It’s because every day brings another little 
		victory that takes me another step along the path to better health. Try it just once and you’ll see why 
		Bikram Choudhury says it makes your body sing. You’ll feel so good that you’ll feel like singing too.<p>

		<font size=2><b>Weight Loss & Flexibility</b></font><p>
		I started going to Bikram Yoga classes in St. Louis approximately 4 months ago around late February of 2004. 
		I must say the benefits I have received in such a short time are remarkable. I have been going to martial arts 
		classes 2-3 times a week since I graduated college in 1990. Many martial artists will understand when I say 
		after 10 years in the martial arts it becomes a lot more about technique, timing and economy of motion than 
		involving a good physical workout. As a result I was considerably out of shape when I started Bikram Yoga. 
		I was also getting injured often in the martial arts classes especially where my joints and back were 
		concerned.<p>My goal starting Bikram Yoga was to hopefully build up core strength so that I would stop getting 
		so many injuries that would keep me from doing what I love, that being the martial arts. I was not concerned 
		about becoming more flexible because I have always been so inflexible that I accepted it as part of my genetic 
		make up. As a result of doing the Bikram Yoga classes 3-5 times a week over the past four months I have 
		received the following benefits many of them unexpected. 1) I have lost 25 lbs and have not changed my diet 
		which includes a lot of pizza and fast food (maybe I will work on that next) 2) The postures have healed all 
		of my joint and back injuries. Everybody in my martial arts classes have noticed how much harder I can go 
		without getting injured. 3) I am much more flexible than I ever thought possible and continue to make 
		improvement. 4) I have stopped snoring (this is actually my wife's benefit and she is so grateful).<p> 
		In conclusion I must comment on the professionalism and quality of the four instructors at the St. Louis 
		Bikram Yoga studio. Carol, Erin, Rick and Becca all are excellent instructors and their close attention to 
		detail and technique clearly enhance all of the students progress. Their knowledge also makes me feel safe as 
		I try harder to improve my technique and endurance. They are really great and even when I come to a class 
		lacking a lot of energy they provide the positive motivation that not only gets me through class but even 
		allows me to have a really good class. I am so glad I found the St. Louis Bikram Yoga studio!<p>--Andy Klearman

		HOT, sweaty stretching<br>

		one breath at a time<p>

		Breathing so deeply<br>
		moist warm air is a blanket<br>
		wrapping me anew<p>

		The hardest part about writing a testimonial for Bikram yoga practice 
		at Bikram Yoga St. Louis is how to not write a book.  I have become a 
		yoga freak, preaching about how this yoga is the best thing in the 
		world and how everyone should try it.  People are getting sick of 
		hearing me say, "If you practiced Bikram yoga you would feel better."
		When I first came in January of 2004, I was a mess.  I had severe 
		post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety and depression, as well as an 
		immune system dysfunction.  After being a successful person for 
		decades, I had completely fallen apart and had become non-functional. 
		All the trauma -- childhood and adult sexual abuse, the murder and 
		suicide of friends and more  -- came crashing in on me.  I was 
		desperately trying everything I could to heal myself when I came upon 
		a testimonial for Bikram yoga, and the person who wrote it had been 
		through many of the same things as myself.  I thought I had tried 
		everything else, so why not this?<p>

		I need to mention I went back on medication to reduce nightmares, 
		flashbacks, insomnia, etc.  But in addition to this, I started a 
		practice of Bikram yoga as often as I could, and had periods where I 
		was sick and had to lay off for weeks, but then would keep going 
		back.  In my first class I was such a baby!  I had a phobia about 
		sauna-like atmospheres because I always feel like I will pass out.  I 
		cannot imagine what my teachers thought of me when I first walked 
		into the studio, and then came running out, asking if I felt faint 
		could I please leave the room!  During that first class I felt like I 
		was going to die and could barely get through it, I was so weak, but 
		7 months later, I make it through class just fine, and have come to 
		crave this yoga.  Now I cannot wait to get into the room and feel the 
		deep heat.  If I go more than a few days without it, I feel it and 
		cannot wait to get back in.<p>

		In general I am calmer, handle stress better, breathe more deeply, 
		and live through the nightmares better.  I also lost my mother 
		unexpectedly 2 months ago, an extremely devastating loss for me, and 
		am working through the grief on top of everything else thanks to this 
		amazing yoga.  I know that if my mom had tried this yoga a year or 
		two ago she would still be here.  And so every time I enter the 
		studio, I dedicate my practice to her.<p>

		There are no words really to describe the experience of Bikram yoga. 
		I had seriously practiced other styles of yoga off and on for years, 
		but never felt the moments of intense bliss and sense of aliveness 
		that I now experience.  My old martial arts foot injuries are almost 
		all healed.  Periods are no longer painful as long as I practice 
		regularly, and my mind and body are gradually healing.  There is no 
		quick fix for the types of challenges I face, and I found that 
		looking for them is an illness in and of itself.  Also, many people 
		claim to be able to heal a person of deep-seated trauma through 
		working with the mind, but I discovered that the more I worked with 
		my mind, the sicker and more traumatized I got on all levels.  It is 
		working with both body and mind in class that I feel I have finally 
		found a practice that sustains, nourishes, and heals me, and gives me 
		hope when I am hurting.  The best part is I am healing myself instead 
		of looking for someone else to fix me.<p>

		I love the heat, the challenge, the way the experience of my mind and 
		body changes each time, even though the postures are the same every 
		time.  I love the relaxation, the deep breathing, deep stretching, 
		and releasing of tension, the incredible sense of cleansing and the 
		gradual lightness and freedom my body is starting to experience.  I 
		love to challenge myself each time -- even in the agony of trying to 
		hold a pose, I am deeply grateful.  I cannot say enough about this 
		practice.<p>

		The teachers of Bikram Yoga St. Louis are amazing and inspiring, the 
		atmosphere is sacred and safe to me. I am so grateful to be sharing 
		my practice with them.  Finally, I need to say that I love and 
		believe in this practice so deeply that I am willing to drive twice a 
		week to the nearest studio, which is 112 miles away.  (I would go 
		more often if I had time but I do have to work!)  Some people think I 
		am crazy but it is crazy not to do it.  Give it a try for at least a 
		couple months and see what happens.  Be open to anything and 
		everything.  Good luck and happy sweating.<p>--C.A.T.
