			 <b>What is a yoga asana championship?</b><br>
			 A yoga asana championship is a competition in which individuals perform a series of yoga asanas and, using standardized judging criteria, are given scores to determine who amongst the 
			 participants is the champion. It is structured much like a gymnastics competition with regards to the performance of the asanas, however the scoring for a yoga asana competition also 
			 includes elements that reflect the character of the individual as a whole—physically, emotionally, mentally and spiritually. For example, points are awarded for the overall attractiveness 
			 of the physical body and its proportions as well as the grace and poise of the individual<p>
			 <b>Why have a yoga competition?</b><br>
			 Yoga competitions are a long standing tradition in India that spans thousands of years. The yoga asana championships promote yoga by creating the propulsion 
			 for dedicated yogis all over to rise to be the best they can be physically, emotionally, mentally and spiritually. The stage is set to allow these yogis to inspire the rest of us and the 
			 community at large to learn more about yoga and how its regular practice can help each of us be a healthier, happier and better person.<p>
			 <b>Why should I participate?</b><br>
			 The very nature of yoga is what keeps yoga competition healthy amongst yogis.  Competitors practice, train and learn together - in the practice room of their school as well as training/coaching 
			 sessions.  They celebrate each others accomplishments and recognize the high bar to which each has achieved.  Competing in yoga championships is a wonderful way for yogis and yoginis to 
			 improve their practice, focus, dedication and express him/herself as an artist. <p>
