		Since starting the practice of Bikram Yoga, I am amazed at the differences I can feel not only in my body, but in my mind as well! As an avid runner and weight lifter, I struggled with 
		flexibility as a whole. After a nasty car accident early this summer, I had resigned myself to the fact that I’d likely never touch my toes again, and that my back, neck and shoulders 
		would always ache just a little.  When a friend invited me to “hot yoga”, I thought I’d give it a shot. Little did I know how GREAT I would feel after!<p>

		Aside from the principles of yoga and their healing benefits, the instructors at Bikram St. Louis have been fantastic – I cannot even begin to choose a favorite! I walk out of each 
		class knowing just a little more about the practice, and about myself overall.  My flexibility has increased tremendously, and my running/lifting is benefiting from the application 
		of the breathing techniques and focus I’ve gained through Bikram. Perhaps the greatest gain for me personally is the sense of calm and balance I walk out of class with…it stays with 
		me for days after. I’ve built in 2 days of Bikram into my cross training program not only because my joints, back, and body love it, but for the wonderful feeling of calm and balance 
		achieved that stays with me for days after.<p>

		DON’T fear the heat – embrace it! This is my new mantra! Thanks for all you do!
