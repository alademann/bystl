		My journey with Bikram Yoga began in December 2009 and I can truly say that this experience has impacted my life in a most positive and profound 
		way. Initially, I had heard about the healing benefits from the specific postures and heat. I wanted to see if it could help my left hand because 
		I had two surgeries in October 2009: carpal tunnel and a tendon taken out of my arm and placed in my CMC thumb joint. After four classes, my range 
		of motion and grip strength had increased by 50%. I had gone through physical therapy and didn’t have those kind of results. And within one month, 
		I could straighten my hand and keep if flat. I had to have the same surgery on my left hand in April 2010 and decided to forgo physical therapy 
		and focus on Bikram Yoga. Once again, the healing results were rapid and amazing. In addition, I have increased flexibility, strength, improved 
		balance and have lost inches. What more could you want? Just keep reading.<p>

		For the first time, I am beginning to really “live in the moment” and neither regretting the past nor worrying about the future. The act of 
		breathing, clearing my mind and “letting it go” before a new posture has moved from the studio into my life. It is about taking that peace and 
		feeling revitalized out into your day. The calmness is incredible and I can now quiet my mind enough to really meditate. To quote Bikram, 
		“This Hatha Yoga will tighten the screws loose in your brain and give you new life” …and I say about time!  <p>

		Needless to say, I was nervous about my first class, but Rebecca went over everything with me and assured me it was “…fine to sit out during 
		Locust because of your hand” or anytime when needed. All of the teachers are supportive, provide positive feedback and challenge me to find a 
		new edge but also remind me to take care of myself - it is a safe environment.<p>

		Thank you so very much for your continued support and encouragement. Plus, I love singing Happy Birthday during Trikanasana!<p>
