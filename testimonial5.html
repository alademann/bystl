		Let's start with some goofy haikus inspired by Bikram yoga:<p>

		HOT, sweaty stretching<br>
		how will I make it through this<br>
		one breath at a time<p>

		Breathing so deeply<br>
		moist warm air is a blanket<br>
		wrapping me anew<p>

		The hardest part about writing a testimonial for Bikram yoga practice 
		at Bikram Yoga St. Louis is how to not write a book.  I have become a 
		yoga freak, preaching about how this yoga is the best thing in the 
		world and how everyone should try it.  People are getting sick of 
		hearing me say, "If you practiced Bikram yoga you would feel better."
		When I first came in January of 2004, I was a mess.  I had severe 
		post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety and depression, as well as an 
		immune system dysfunction.  After being a successful person for 
		decades, I had completely fallen apart and had become non-functional. 
		All the trauma -- childhood and adult sexual abuse, the murder and 
		suicide of friends and more  -- came crashing in on me.  I was 
		desperately trying everything I could to heal myself when I came upon 
		a testimonial for Bikram yoga, and the person who wrote it had been 
		through many of the same things as myself.  I thought I had tried 
		everything else, so why not this?<p>

		I need to mention I went back on medication to reduce nightmares, 
		flashbacks, insomnia, etc.  But in addition to this, I started a 
		practice of Bikram yoga as often as I could, and had periods where I 
		was sick and had to lay off for weeks, but then would keep going 
		back.  In my first class I was such a baby!  I had a phobia about 
		sauna-like atmospheres because I always feel like I will pass out.  I 
		cannot imagine what my teachers thought of me when I first walked 
		into the studio, and then came running out, asking if I felt faint 
		could I please leave the room!  During that first class I felt like I 
		was going to die and could barely get through it, I was so weak, but 
		7 months later, I make it through class just fine, and have come to 
		crave this yoga.  Now I cannot wait to get into the room and feel the 
		deep heat.  If I go more than a few days without it, I feel it and 
		cannot wait to get back in.<p>

		In general I am calmer, handle stress better, breathe more deeply, 
		and live through the nightmares better.  I also lost my mother 
		unexpectedly 2 months ago, an extremely devastating loss for me, and 
		am working through the grief on top of everything else thanks to this 
		amazing yoga.  I know that if my mom had tried this yoga a year or 
		two ago she would still be here.  And so every time I enter the 
		studio, I dedicate my practice to her.<p>

		There are no words really to describe the experience of Bikram yoga. 
		I had seriously practiced other styles of yoga off and on for years, 
		but never felt the moments of intense bliss and sense of aliveness 
		that I now experience.  My old martial arts foot injuries are almost 
		all healed.  Periods are no longer painful as long as I practice 
		regularly, and my mind and body are gradually healing.  There is no 
		quick fix for the types of challenges I face, and I found that 
		looking for them is an illness in and of itself.  Also, many people 
		claim to be able to heal a person of deep-seated trauma through 
		working with the mind, but I discovered that the more I worked with 
		my mind, the sicker and more traumatized I got on all levels.  It is 
		working with both body and mind in class that I feel I have finally 
		found a practice that sustains, nourishes, and heals me, and gives me 
		hope when I am hurting.  The best part is I am healing myself instead 
		of looking for someone else to fix me.<p>

		I love the heat, the challenge, the way the experience of my mind and 
		body changes each time, even though the postures are the same every 
		time.  I love the relaxation, the deep breathing, deep stretching, 
		and releasing of tension, the incredible sense of cleansing and the 
		gradual lightness and freedom my body is starting to experience.  I 
		love to challenge myself each time -- even in the agony of trying to 
		hold a pose, I am deeply grateful.  I cannot say enough about this 
		practice.<p>

		The teachers of Bikram Yoga St. Louis are amazing and inspiring, the 
		atmosphere is sacred and safe to me. I am so grateful to be sharing 
		my practice with them.  Finally, I need to say that I love and 
		believe in this practice so deeply that I am willing to drive twice a 
		week to the nearest studio, which is 112 miles away.  (I would go 
		more often if I had time but I do have to work!)  Some people think I 
		am crazy but it is crazy not to do it.  Give it a try for at least a 
		couple months and see what happens.  Be open to anything and 
		everything.  Good luck and happy sweating.<p>
