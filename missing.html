<-- On any given Web server, numerical codes are used to represent various server (or Web site) errors. The 404 error represents a Web site's failure to find a page sought by a visitor. Generally, there are two causes for a 404 error: 1) the page does not exist at all, or 2) the page name was misspelled by the visitor on his/her browser (or by you in your Web development tool).  The 404 error page is thus the Web page that displays on a browser whenever the error is triggered.  -->
