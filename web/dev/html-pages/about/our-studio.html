  <div class="span10">

    We would need to compose a piece for the “Our Studio”, maybe when we opened, why we wanted to bring BY to St. Louis, a link to our “meet the Staff” page.  I think a great place to point out “All our instructors are Bikram certified, which means we have completed Bikram’s rigorous and thorough 500 hour training program.  We are here to help, so please feel free to approach us with questions and concerns.”
