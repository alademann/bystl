<p>Beginning Bikram Yoga first as a student, looking for a therapeutic way to regain the use of her shoulder, she then realized this practice was now becoming an amazing and personal journey as well. Her practice continued to lead her down the path to become a teacher of Bikram Yoga, one she is thankful for everyday.</p><!--more-->

<p>Catherine is many things, a Mother, Wife, Grandmother, Sister, Aunt, Friend, Student, Teacher, Writer, Actress, Adventurer, and Dreamer.  Catherine feels truly blessed.</p>

<p>As a life long exercise enthusiast Catherine had to change her practice from distance cycling to rehabbing her disconnected shoulder after getting hit by a car while cycling.</p>

<p>This was a life changing event that left her shoulder with a plate, five screws, and almost no range of motion, but giving her a special opportunity to start from scratch.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s never too late, it&rsquo;s never too bad, and you&rsquo;re never too old or too sick to start from scratch.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>-Bikram&rsquo;s Guru, Bishnu Ghosh</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It comes as no surprise to her now, that she has discovered Bikram Yoga and that it will be a life long practice.  Bikram Yoga has been a playground, a laboratory, a community, and an extended family for over 4 years.</p>

<p>It has been a practice that has allowed her to only just begin to appreciate how much BALANCE has to do with feeling free and happy.</p>

<p>As a teacher she feels fortunate to spend 90 minutes with so many amazing PEOPLE, all sharing their own incredible journey.</p>

<p>She would like everyone to, &ldquo;Trust  the process of Bikram Yoga, trust your own individual practice, and enjoy the ride wherever it may take you.&rdquo;</p>
