This plugin gives you the ability you to manage testimonials, add pictures to them, and let users submit them where they wait for approval.

== Description ==

With IQ Testimonials, you can easily manage the testimonials for your website. You can specify the number of testimonials displayed on your WordPress site according to wether they are being displayed on a page or widget.

You can feature, sort, and set the status (Hidden, Pending, Public) of testimonials.  There is even a form so your users can submit testimonials right on your website.  Best of all, they are marked pending and require your approval before they go public!
