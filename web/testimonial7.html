		<p>I came to Bikram yoga 7 months ago at age 61. I was active (running, weight
		lifting and another yoga practice) but still had chronic issues with asthma
		and high blood pressure. I thought I'd gotten any benefits I could from
		exercise.</p>

		<p>When I began my Bikram journey I was using 2 medications for my blood
		pressure and 4 daily medications just to control my asthma (6 during bad
		periods). As I've very slowly progressed in my practice, I've been able to
		drop medications gradually...with the supervision of my physician of course.
		First one blood pressure medication, then the second. Now I'm off all my
		asthma drugs, including the rescue inhaler.</p>

		<p>This morning I ran with no asthma medication for the first time ever. I
		can't tell you how good that felt. I'm feeling great, minus the thousands
		of dollars of drugs I needed just six months ago.</p>

		<p>It's true that we're never too old or too sick....</p>
