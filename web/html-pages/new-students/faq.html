    <dt>What should I expect?</dt>

    <dt>What should I bring?</dt>
    <dd>An open mind and a positive attitude.</dd>

<hr />
    <dt>What about water?</dt>
    <dd>You should drink plenty of water everyday, this is better than just drinking water before or during class.</dd>
    <dd>With <a href="[blogurl]about/bikram-yoga">Bikram Yoga</a>, you are simultaneously cleansing all the systems of your body from the inside out. It is important to stay hydrated so your elimination systems <em>(bowel, urinary, and skin)</em> can support your efforts.</dd>
<hr />
    <dt>What if I have injuries or illnesses?</dt>
    <dd>Please let the teacher know if you are pregnant, had surgery, or have any injuries, illnesses, or special conditions.</dd>
    <dd>You can still do most yoga postures, with a few modifications that the teacher will show you.</dd>
<hr />
    <dt>What if I am pregnant?</dt>
    <dd>A regular practice before becoming pregnant is required in order to resume practicing during your second trimester. Please <a href="[blogurl]about/contact-us">Contact BYSTL</a> for more information.</dd>
<hr />
    <dt>How long is class?</dt>
    <dd>Bikram&rsquo;s Beginning Hatha Yoga class is 90 minutes in length.</dd>
<hr />
    <dt>How often should I come?</dt>
    <dd>Come as often as you can.</dd>
    <dd>A daily practice from the beginning can relax into a regimen of 3 or 4 times per week. You'll find you want to do this practice. It's fun! It works! You will start organizing your schedule to fit it in. In fact, the harder this yoga is for you initially, the more you need to do it and the more you are going to benefit from it. The time and effort you put into Bikram Yoga will be returned to you tenfold.</dd>
