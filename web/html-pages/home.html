<p class="h1">Bikram is designed for beginners!</h1>
<p>It is common to feel nervous, scared, or even a little intimidated to try <a href="[blogurl]about/bikram-yoga">Bikram Yoga</a>. We have all felt that at the beginning of our practice. Just don&rsquo;t let that stop you from coming to class. <em>Bikram Yoga is designed for beginners and with a little practice, you&rsquo;ll quickly feel right at home.</em></p>
<p class="h2">Thinking about trying a class?</p>
<p class="lead flushBot"><strong>First-time students must arrive 15-30 minutes early regardless of previous experience.</strong></p>
<p>We want you to have time to get registered and orientated, meet your instructor, and get acquainted to your new home away from home. We recommend all students arrive 15 minutes before class in order to allow their body to get acclimated to the hot room. We begin every class on time and do not permit late entry. Please come early to avoid disappointment.</p>
<p class="lead flushBot"><strong>Come to class well hydrated.</strong></p>
<p>Proper hydration supports the healthy function of all your body&rsquo;s systems and it makes the heat feel comfortable rather than overwhelming.</p>
<p class="lead flushBot"><strong>Come to class with your <a href="[blogurl]wp-content/media/BYSTL_New-Student-Registration.pdf" target="_blank">new student registration form</a> filled out.</strong></p>
<p><em>We are looking forward to breaking a sweat with you!</em></p>
