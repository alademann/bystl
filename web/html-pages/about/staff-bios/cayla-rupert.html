<p>Cayla recently took a giant leap of faith and made a career change from pharmaceutical sales to nursing.  She just finished up her first year of nursing school and she absolutely loves it.</p>

<p>Cayla believes life is too short to not love what you are doing.  Aside from doing Bikram Yoga she enjoys rollerblading <em>(totally 80s)</em>! She could eat Mexican food every day of the week and her favorite drink is a pineapple margarita from Chavas <em>(how fitting)</em>.</p>
