<p>Rebecca walked into a Bikram Yoga class 9 years ago with NO idea what she was getting herself into&hellip;</p>

<p>It was hot, difficult, and she loved it! She knew right away that this was something that she would, and did incorporate into her daily life. Rebecca&rsquo;s passion has only grown over the years and transformed from being a dedicated student to <em>(in 2006)</em> becoming a dedicated teacher <em>and</em> student.</p>

<p>Rebecca can&rsquo;t wait to see you in the hot room for a sweaty, moving meditation followed by an addictive post class state of bliss!</p>
