<p>Carol began practicing Bikram Yoga in the fall of 2001 in Dallas, TX and fell in love with the practice right away. Never before had a workout incorporated such intense physical challenges, as well as the stress relief and emotional healing that she experienced from Bikram Yoga.</p>

<p>Within a year of taking her first class, she decided to quit her IT consulting job to complete Bikram&rsquo;s Teacher Training in Los Angeles, CA. She was determined to share this yoga with as many people as possible so they may also experience this life-changing series.</p><!--more-->

<p>After graduating from Teacher Training in November 2002, she and <a href="[blogurl]dev/about/our-staff/erin-stack/">Erin Stack</a> taught at the Dallas studio together and decided to open their own studio in Erin&rsquo;s hometown of St. Louis, MO. They opened the doors to their current location in September of 2003 and the rest is history!</p>

<p>Born and raised in West Texas, Carol takes pride in her southern roots and her Texas Longhorns. In addition to practicing Bikram Yoga, Carol loves spending time with her husband and baby boy, and enjoys taking jazz, modern, and hip-hop dance classes around the St. Louis area.</p>

<p>Carol strives to provide an atmosphere where you are challenged in her classes, yet motivated to achieve more than you thought possible. She truly believes if you can do Bikram Yoga, you can do anything!</p>
