<p>Talia began practicing Bikram Yoga in 2004 in her home town of Naperville, IL, a suburb of Chicago.  She would drive pass the studio everyday after high school and contemplate trying out this studio located atop a Walgreens, <em>(and yes while lying in Savasannah, you can hear who needs to pick up their prescription)</em>.</p>

<p>Not being a huge fan of going to the gym or using the treadmill in the basement, one cold November day, Talia finally took the other 5 members of her family to a class to give it a try.</p><!--more-->

<p>Needless to say she and the rest of her family haven't been able to stay away ever since.  Her family instantly fell in love and always make an effort to take class together on the rare occasion they are all in the same city.</p>

<p>Yoga has given her a sense of grounding and dissolved an immense amount of physical pain while helping her strengthen her emotional and spiritual health.</p>

<p>Talia moved down to St. Louis in 2009 and has loved being a part of the St. Louis Bikram yoga community ever since.  Within the series of Bikram Yoga, Talia has found peace and health, that she has never found in other practices.  This practice will always play a huge role in her daily expressions.</p>

<p>While yoga is such a visually beautiful movement, it has carried over into other aspects of her life.  Yoga is one of her major passions, as it focuses on the art of the body and assists with her other love, the art of photography.</p>

<p>When Talia is not in the hot box, she is photographing newborns in the hospital, working on her own photography business, Blissful Impressions, and spending time with her husband, Noel and puppy Cora.</p>

<p>Also, contrary to popular belief, it is definitely NOT impossible to lick your elbow!</p>
