<p>Natalie only intended to try Bikram Yoga.</p>

<p>In a rather serendipitous way, Natalie’s yoga teacher at a YMCA gym endorsed Bikram Yoga into her awareness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bikram Yoga is like no other experience you will ever have.  So, if you ever have a chance,&rdquo; the teacher recommended,  &ldquo;grab a friend and try it.&rdquo; To drive it in further, the teacher added with some firmness  &ldquo;Just try it.&rdquo;</p><!--more-->

<p>That was ten years ago.  Natalie still remembers the teacher’s words because the next day Natalie moved one state west into California and settled two blocks from a Bikram Yoga studio.</p>

<p>There were as many opinions on Bikram Yoga then as there are today.  As  I said, Natalie intended to try it.  Just try it.  One class was enough.  Afterwards Natalie thought she would then claim the experience of having done it, be better off for having tried something new, toss her opinion into the ring of opinions and then be on her way.</p>

<p>However, the studio offered her a special rate on two weeks of yoga.  So long as she agreed to try just two classes, the numbers were in her favor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That $14 saved my life,&rdquo; says Natalie today,  &ldquo;Bottomline, I never knew I could feel so good.  And that feeling remains!  And grows!  And evolves!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Natalie has taken a few thousand classes since having decided to try it.  She attended teacher training in 2006.   Natalie still continues to be amazed as she realizes there is much much much more to her Self than she had previously imagined.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My practice,&rdquo; says Natalie &ldquo;serves to teach me how to live the life I have.&rdquo;</p>
