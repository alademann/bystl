<p>Catherine took her first few Bikram classes in the summer of 2005, but equates her experiences of taking class then to feeling like "Pigpen" <em>(Peanuts)</em> because of her unhealthy smoking habit.</p>

<p>After shying away from the practice for a year, Catherine finally quit smoking for good and began a somewhat regular practice of Bikram Yoga in July of 2006.</p><!--more-->

<p>As she grew to know and love the yoga her practice became more consistent, and she went on to complete teacher training in June, 2007.  She taught her first class on June 19 - the one year anniversary of the day she quit smoking and continues to teach in St. Louis and Chesterfield.</p>

<p>In keeping with her great passion for Bikram Yoga, Catherine has attended Rajashree and Emmy's women's retreat in Coco Beach <em>(fall of 2009)</em> and Bikram's advanced seminar in San Diego <em>(fall of 2010)</em> where she also received her re-certification.</p>

<p>She has also attended workshops with Craig Villiani, Ren Soriano, and Mary Jarvis, and attends teacher training and posture clinics when it is possible for her to do so.</p>

<p>Because of her job as a flight attendant, Catherine has had the opportunity to practice at many wonderful studios within the Bikram Yoga community all over the country and feels blessed to be able to practice with so many wonderful people, both students and teachers, from so many different walks of life.</p>

<p>Catherine has competed regionally in the Midwest Bishnu Gosh Asana Competition since 2007 <em>(placing 3rd 2007-2008, and 1st 2009-2011)</em>, and has also had the honor and joy of demonstrating &amp; competing nationally 2010-2012.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;A consistent practice offers many, many quiet and personal joys.</p>

    <p>For me, competitions and challenges are wonderful tools that give me an extra push to maintain this consistency, and thus improve my focus and concentration in my practice, and stay more connected in my life.</p>

    <p>When I am in the zone -that wonderfully quiet, still place- all the pettiness of everyday occurrences are replaced with a better sense of gratitude and fulfillment.</p>

    <p>Without getting too caught up in it, scoring can be a great tool to monitor an individual's progress. But really, just feeling the amazing places your body can go when worked and nurtured on a regular basis is <em>&lsquo;the win&rsquo;</em>.</p>

    <p>Anyone who practices regularly <em>(at least 2-3 times a week)</em>, who participates in 30+day challenges, or competes, will gain so many healing benefits from the focus, determination, concentration, hope and faith that the Bikram Yoga practice allows-including inner freedom, peace and confidence.</p>

    <p>Regular practice, competitions, the challenges- these are all wonderful ways to create a community where we can encourage each other and be inspired by each others&rsquo; as well as our own paths and practices- where ever we happen to be along each our varied maps in life. </p>

    <p>So much is possible and there is nothing like this healing process, from bones to skin, fingertips to toes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Catherine currently lives in St. Louis with her fiancé, Michael, and their cat, Toonces- who has yet to get her driver’s license (SNL).</p>
