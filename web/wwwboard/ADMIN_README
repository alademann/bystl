SUMMARY:
--------

wwwadmin.pl is a script which allows you maintain and administer a discussion
forum on the web.

FILES:
------

Here are the files pertaining to wwwadmin:
  wwwadmin.pl   - An administration tool to delete messages
  passwd.txt    - The encoded password and username for wwwadmin
  ADMIN_README  - wwwadmin config and install instruction.

CONFIGURATION and INSTALLATION:
-------------------------------

The configuration of wwwadmin.pl is very similar to wwwboard.pl. In fact, for all but two parameter settings, it should be the same as in wwwboad.pl (ie. copy paste them over from wwwboard.pl). Here is what should be set and how wwwadmin should be installed:

* wwwadmin.pl
   Settings (remember to carry other parameters over from wwwboard.pl):

      $cgi_url     - This is the full website address (URL) to the wwwboard.pl
                     file which will run the wwwboard.

      $passwd_file - This is the name of the file, in $basedir, where the
                     username and password for the board administrator will be
                     stored.

   Installation:
      You must upload this file to your server's cgi-bin or in a directory where
      CGI execution is allowed. Make sure the directory and path match the
      $cgi_url put in the settings. You must also give the file the right
      permissions. In order to do so, the file must be chmoded to 755 using the
      following command:
         chmod 755 wwwboard.pl

* password.txt
   Settings:
      None.

   Installation:
      Simply upload this file to $basedir, as mentionned in wwwadmin.pl. You
      also have to chmod the file to 666 (no, we are not the devil) using the
      following command:
         chmod 666 password.txt

USAGE:
------

RUNNING WWWADMIN.
        WWWAdmin is a self-contained script, in that all you have to do is 
   call the script with a plain url (The url you used in $cgi_url) and it 
   will give you a form which displays all of your options.  The options 
   that are currently available in this release are:
        Remove Messages
        Remove Messages by Date
        Remove Messages by Author
        Remove Messages by Sorted Number
        Change WWWAdmin Password

All of these options require you to use a password and username once you 
take the link.  The default username and password for WWWAdmin are:

Username: WebAdmin
Password: WebBoard

They are case sensitive, so make sure you type them in correctly.  I suggest 
you jump down to the explanation on Changing WWWAdmin Password before 
you make this wwwboard available to the public.  A brief description of 
how each WWWAdmin function works is below:

REMOVE MESSAGES
===============
        When selecting this link, you will be taken to a form which gives you 
the article number, two radio boxes, the subject, author and date that 
the article was posted, for all articles.  The form is put inside of a 
Netscape table, but I have tested it and it also works with lynx (a text 
based browser) so I am sure it will work with others.  You can check the 
radio boxes to the side of the messages that you wish to remove from 
your WWWBoard.  Checking the check box to the left, will remove the 
entire thread, while checking the check box on the right, simply removes 
that single posting, whether it is imbeded in a thread or not.  This 
will also remove the message out of your messages/ directory, and if you 
select to remove the thread, it will remove all messages in that thread 
out of your messages/ directory.

REMOVE MESSAGES BY DATE
=======================
        This link will pop up a form that looks something like this:

  Checkbox   Date1   # of Messages  Message Numbers

You can click in the checkbox next to any dates of your choice and it 
will remove all files that were posted on that date.  To see what files 
are going to be removed and how many, you can look at the columns 
labeled # of messages and message numbers.  If messages of an earlier 
date happen to be at the head of a thread, they will be removed and the 
next response down in the thread becomes the head of that thread.  It 
will only remove messages with that date.

REMOVE MESSAGES BY AUTHOR
=========================
        This link will pop up a form very similar to that which the Remove 
Message by Date link brought up.  Except instead of different dates, you 
will see the names of authors of messages.  You can check the checkbox 
next to an authors name to remove all postings that he or she posted to 
your message board.

REMOVE MESSAGES BY SORTED NUMBER
================================
        This link brings up a form identical to the plain Remove Messages form, 
except that the postings are sorted from lowest number to highest 
number.  This can be useful if you want to delete postings in the order 
they were posted, but this is probably the l east useful remove function.

CHANGE PASSWORD
===============
        This form will ask you to fill in your current username and password 
and allow you to change your username and password to whatever you 
like.  If you want to keep the username the same, you can simply not 
fill in the 'New Username' part of the script.  When changing your 
password, which I suggest you do right when you get WWWAdmin working, 
you will need to type the new password two times in a row, just to make 
sure you don't mis-type it.  Then, hit submit and if you input the 
correct old username and password, you will be given a response that 
tells you the new username and password.  Do not forget your password, 
because it will be encrypted in the passwd.txt file, just like your Unix 
login password.  You will need to re-download the wwwadmin tool...
