	The Bikram Yoga studio in St. Louis is so amazing.  The practice, the teachers, and the students have changed my life.  
	I cannot thank you all enough.<p>

	Before Bikram Yoga, I was self-destructive.  I had been bulimic for 10 years.  I had tried so hard to stop so many 
	different times, but it was almost like I didn’t know how to do anything else.  I am a very together person, and you 
	would never guess that I was struggling with this demon.  It was the way I dealt with the pressures and stresses in 
	my life.  Through Bikram Yoga, I’ve learned other ways to deal with life and have found acceptance of myself the way I am.  
	I’m not perfect and never will be but that’s finally ok.  I also gained a newfound respect for myself and a sense of worth.<p>
  
	I started Bikram Yoga yoga twice.  The first time was at the request of one of my friends who had been trying to get me to come 
	for over a year.  I finally relented and came.  Like most, I’m not really sure what happened my first class, and I surprised 
	myself by coming back.  I had heard the amazing weight loss Bikram Yoga could produce and that was pretty much my motivation.  
	I came about twice a week and certainly saw changes in my body.  Over Christmas, I was unable to practice because I was 
	too far away from a studio, so I decided to read Bikram’s book and to learn something about this yoga that I was practicing.<p>

	My health then took an abrupt turn, and I ended up in ICU.  To put it mildly, I did not take very good care of my body up to 
	that point in my life.  Although I followed all my doctor’s orders, I was unable to get healthy again.  I literally couldn’t 
	walk and talk on the phone at the same time.  Fortunately, I made my way back to the yoga studio.  Having read Bikram’s book, 
	I was determined to practice yoga everyday for 2 months.  I would highly recommend this to anyone-whether you are a beginner 
	or a veteran.  It changed my practice, my body, and my mental well-being.  I am proof that Bikram Yoga can heal your body and 
	your soul.  I was both physically and mentally sick when I started out with the goal of practicing everyday for 2 months.<p>
  
	Having to look at myself in the mirror everyday for 90 minutes was a constant struggle for me.  Prior to Bikram Yoga, I don’t 
	think I ever looked in the mirror and liked what I saw.  But when you have to look at yourself for 90 minutes everyday, you 
	start down the road toward acceptance and eventually toward loving yourself.  It is not an easy journey.  The good news is that 
	no one can tell if you are crying-the sweat takes care of that!  And the better news is that if you stick with it, it will 
	change your life and your image of yourself.  I don’t usually stand in the front.  I’m not ready to see myself that closely.  
	It is a process for me.  Yoga has taught me to understand the process and to enjoy where I am at the moment.  It is about 
	accepting who you are and what your body can do on any given day. <p>
 
	There are so many benefits to Bikram Yoga - both physical and mental.  Like I said, my main motivation at first was simply 
	weight loss.  But I have received so much more.  I am finally comfortable with who I am and what I look like.  Don’t get me 
	wrong, there are things I would change if I could, and looking in the mirror is really hard on some days.  But it is finally 
	ok.  By the way, I did achieve the weight loss I was seeking.  I wear a single digit size (ladies, you know what I’m talking about) 
	for the first time since high school and have maintained my size for about a year.  Bikram Yoga changed my body and changed 
	my eating patterns.  I finally learned to listen to what my body was craving and what it needed.  I’m not “normal” but I’m better
	and getting better all the time.<p>

	Although the physical changes are great, the main benefit of Bikram Yoga is truly the mental benefits.  My concentration and 
	focus have increased incredibly.  It used to be extremely difficult for me to sit still and concentrate on one thing.  I am now 
	able to do so and have reaped the rewards of that skill greatly.  I have also learned to let things go and the power of my 
	breath.  Feelings are real and they happen, but that doesn’t mean I have to let them dictate my reactions.  I am in control of 
	my responses.  That is such an empowering feeling, especially for someone who has spent so much time feeling out of control. <p>
       
	I cannot say enough about the incredible teachers in St. Louis.  Walking into the studio is always a highlight in my day.  I know 
	that I will be greeted with a smile and that they are happy to see me.  And I know that they are rooting for me.  They may not 
	know exactly what is going on in my life or what I’m working through, but they are on my side and want me to succeed.  That is 
	so amazing.  Don’t get me wrong, they challenge us and kick our butts everyday but their motivation is that they want us to 
	be strong and better people.<p>

	Some of the things that the teachers have said in class have truly stuck with me, and have become my mantras.  Get to know 
	the teachers.  They are amazing people!<p>

	Tavis was my teacher for both of my first classes and has a very special place in my heart.  At the beginning of class, he always 
	says to look in your own two eyes and if you can’t then to look at your abdomen and then your chest and then your forehead and 
	then the area between your two eyes and that someday you will be able to meet your gaze in your own two eyes.  It is so true!  
	For me, Bikram Yoga has been a scary undertaking.  It’s hot and hard and difficult things come up during class.  Tavis has a 
	very reassuring presence in the room.  I love the end of his class when he encourages us to take the yoga off our mats.  
	At first, I’m pretty sure I rolled my eyes (sorry!), but it is really true.  I am living proof that yoga can affect all 
	aspects of your life if you let it.<p>

	Erin one class said to look in the mirror to see the truth and that it is only once you see the truth that you can change it.  
	I remember thinking that I didn’t want to see the truth, but once I accepted the truth, she was right, the truth changed.  
	Her boundless energy never ceases to amaze.<p>    

	Natalie says to listen to your body and to do what your body can do today.  This has been such a hard lesson for me to learn.  
	I have been practicing for a year and a half, and sometimes I still have to sit out the majority of class.  I used to beat myself 
	up after hard classes.  One day I finally heard what Natalie and the other teachers had been telling us everyday.  Natalie also 
	is big on setting an intention for the class.  I like it.  It makes me think about what I’m doing in what Natalie calls the 
	“horrible, hard, and hot” room and to let everything else go.<p>

	Angel always pushes me to my limits, and I love it!  I really appreciate his readings at the end of class.  There was one in 
	particular about “surrender” that has stuck with me.  Angel says to check your ego at the door, and it is so true.  It really 
	changed my practice once I started to apply those things.  He is always entertaining and motivating.  During awkward pose, 
	Angel once said: “You are strong.  You can do this.”  I have used that on myself ever since inside and outside the yoga 
	room.  I think it is a good way of summing up the mantra of Bikram Yoga.<p>   

	Rebecca is 100% rooting for us.  It is as if she can see what we are capable of before we know we can achieve it.  She calls 
	us “friend” and “sister” during class.  It demonstrates that she’s in this with us.  She knows it is hard, but she’s pulling 
	for us.  I had Rebecca a ton when I first came back from being sick.  I felt very taken care of and comfortable with Rebecca.  
	Rebecca is energetic and motivating and just fabulous.  I love it when she tells us to do something and then asks: “why not?” <p>          

	Carol walks into the room and says “hello my little chickadees” with a smile.  But we all know that she is going to kick our 
	butts!  You are not fooling anyone. :) Carol has a way of making us understand what the words actually mean.  Sometimes you 
	hear the words so many times that you forget to listen.  I really appreciate the effort she makes to ensure that we are doing 
	the postures correctly.  Carol’s corrections have made a huge impact in my postures and practice.  Even after two years of 
	practice, I learn something new in every single class.  (Which is probably why it is never boring to do the same 26 postures!)<p>

	JJ is so full of energy and excited about what we’re doing.  She’s a great addition to the teaching staff.  There is a warmth 
	about JJ that just exudes from her.  I feel like I’ve gotten a big hug from her from just walking in the studio.<p>

	Catherine is also a wonderful addition to the Clayton studio.  She has a very soothing voice that I find calming during 
	class.  I really appreciate her focus on breathing.  You wouldn’t think that you would forget to breathe, but it is so 
	easy to start holding your breath during hard postures, which just makes them worse.<p>   

	Every once in a while we get to steal Sarah from Chesterfield for a few classes.  It is always a treat!  I love the technicality
	that Sarah brings to class.  I try to listen hard to what she is saying during class, because I know I’m going to learn 
	something new.  I’m not going to lie, every once in a while I’ve had to look up the body part that she names because I have 
	no clue what the word means?  One time, Sarah had me demonstrate a posture in class.  I had never done anything like that 
	before and was so freaked out.  But the confidence that Sarah had in me was contagious and made me have confidence in myself. <p>       

	I obviously go to the Clayton studio.  But the few times I’ve had the Chesterfield teachers, I’ve loved them too!  <p>    

	Thank you to all the teachers and to all the students.  You have truly changed my life.  <p>
