		I started going to Bikram Yoga classes in St. Louis approximately 4 months ago around late February of 2004. 
		I must say the benefits I have received in such a short time are remarkable. I have been going to martial arts 
		classes 2-3 times a week since I graduated college in 1990. Many martial artists will understand when I say 
		after 10 years in the martial arts it becomes a lot more about technique, timing and economy of motion than 
		involving a good physical workout. As a result I was considerably out of shape when I started Bikram Yoga. 
		I was also getting injured often in the martial arts classes especially where my joints and back were 
		concerned.<p>My goal starting Bikram Yoga was to hopefully build up core strength so that I would stop getting 
		so many injuries that would keep me from doing what I love, that being the martial arts. I was not concerned 
		about becoming more flexible because I have always been so inflexible that I accepted it as part of my genetic 
		make up. As a result of doing the Bikram Yoga classes 3-5 times a week over the past four months I have 
		received the following benefits many of them unexpected. 1) I have lost 25 lbs and have not changed my diet 
		which includes a lot of pizza and fast food (maybe I will work on that next) 2) The postures have healed all 
		of my joint and back injuries. Everybody in my martial arts classes have noticed how much harder I can go 
		without getting injured. 3) I am much more flexible than I ever thought possible and continue to make 
		improvement. 4) I have stopped snoring (this is actually my wife's benefit and she is so grateful).<p> 
		In conclusion I must comment on the professionalism and quality of the four instructors at the St. Louis 
		Bikram Yoga studio. Carol, Erin, Rick and Becca all are excellent instructors and their close attention to 
		detail and technique clearly enhance all of the students progress. Their knowledge also makes me feel safe as 
		I try harder to improve my technique and endurance. They are really great and even when I come to a class 
		lacking a lot of energy they provide the positive motivation that not only gets me through class but even 
		allows me to have a really good class. I am so glad I found the St. Louis Bikram Yoga studio!<p>
