		At the age of 12 I had a fondness for jumping down flights of stairs. We lived in a 3 story 
		townhouse and the jumping became a constant challenge for me. How many stairs can I jump this 
		time? Well, one day my Mom decided to rearrange furniture. In doing so, she moved a huge marble 
		potted plant at the end of the second floor flight of stairs. I realized this mid jump. The next 
		thing I remember is my Mother running in circles, trying to decide if she should carry me to the 
		car while dialing 911. I hopped to the car. We passed the ambulance going to the hospital. My 
		leg was cut through the bone. Additionally, the soil from the potted plant was embedded into the 
		tissue along with parts of the pot. The doctor suggested amputation because of the high chance 
		of infection and or gangrene. My Mother - bless her - said " You didn't put it on, you are not 
		taking it off". That was the last I heard of amputation, though I was told I would never walk 
		again. It took me a year to walk again, 2 years to walk without a limp. In 3 years, I was 
		running in short races. <p>
		I entered the military and out ran Marines. I did this for 8 years. As a civilian, I continued 
		to run, though I began to experience knee problems on the injured leg. This progressively 
		worsened to the point where I could no longer run, my weight ballooned. I sought medical help. 
		The orthopedic doctor diagnosed Chondromalacia Patellae, which is a fancy schmancy word for 
		runners knee. At this point, I could barely cross my legs. I became envious of women who could 
		perform this posture with ease. I went through 300 dollars worth of physical therapy and 
		experienced NO relief. <p>
		A friend of mine at work talked about "Hot Yoga". After a few attempts, she finally succeeded 
		in getting me there - in long pants but I forgiver her. I have not been back to physical 
		therapy. I experienced relief immediately. After 1 month, I could grab both feet in floor bow. 
		My new goal is the double wrap required for Eagle pose. I can now cross my legs for longer 
		periods of time and without any pain. I no longer think when going up or down stairs. I have 
		lost 18 pounds and I don't know how many inches. I seem to crave the heat and the routine. As 
		I type this, a snowstorm is predicted and all I can think about is "Will they have yoga tonight?” 
		The instructors are wonderful! There is a standard level of discipline that is delivered by 
		each, with a different style and sense of humor. Hot yoga has become one of the best parts 
		of my day! God bless my friend for getting me to a place that has introduced me to an exercise 
		I believe I can do the rest of my life. <p>
